# Personality Clustering

This project considers the big five personality traits - Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism. This personality model is also known as the OCEAN model in psychology. 
It is used to better understand a person's overall behaviour and attitude by giving each attribute a rank. The chosen dataset does this thoroughly.

This dataset ranks every trait on a scale of 1 to 10 - 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest. 
The data is in the form of a matrix where each row represents an individual and each column represents the scale of each trait. 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is done on the data to reduce the dimensions so that the results can be attained more efficiently.
The K-Means clustering algorithm can identify patterns and similarities in the data and perform clustering of similar personality types.
